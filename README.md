# HIT_ML_Project - Loan

Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss).
The credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed.
In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'.

In addition, We know that our standard of living in growing, people are wasting more money for many reasons (we will see it later on).
This brings a lot of people to ask for a money loan from various loan companies.
Every company (as mentioned earlier) do not want to lose money and this is the point that we are getting into control.

**We are going to "help" those loan companies (in our case: LendingClub) to have a better risk analytics about each person, identify these risky loan applicants and to predict if they should approve the loan to a random person or not.**
